<h1>The IF Archive CSS Competition: Rules</h1>

<div class="Description">

<em>
The CSSComp ran from January to mid-February of 2009.
We are no longer accepting submissions. See the
<a href="index.html">competition page</a>
for the winner and the rest of the entries.

The rules are preserved below for future reference.

When I (Andrew Plotkin) set up the IF Archive index pages -- it was just an
HTTP mirror of ftp.gmd.de, then -- I didn't make them pretty. I wrote some
classic, visually-neutral HTML, same as I used to make my first web page in
1993. The only styled element was a little box quote.
</p>

<p>
That's still how it looks. A little Neo-Web-Brutalist composition of black,
white, list bullets, horizontal rules, and Times Roman (unless your web
browser is set up with some other defaults).
</p>

<p>
We, the Archive management folks, would like to change that. Therefore: the
IF Archive CSS Competition. Submit a CSS file to make the Archive less ugly!
Deadline is Feb 8th. We'll use the best submission.
</p>

<p>
...That's the short rule. Here are the long rules.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
- This is actually two competitions -- Popular Choice and Archive
Maintainers' Choice. We want to know what everybody likes, but we will make
the final decision on what we actually use. We promise to weigh the Popular
Choice very heavily in our selection.
</p>

<p>
- On the <a href="index.html">CSSComp site</a>, you'll see five sample HTML
pages: a copy of the front page, the root index page, 
an index page from down in the stacks, a directory list,
and a random informational page. They all draw on
"./ifarchive.css", which defines nothing except a quotebox style and a
little bit of boldface. In other words, they look exactly like the real
Archive pages. (Most of the links are inactive, though.)
</p>

<p>
- Download those files. (<a href="start.zip">Here is a zip file.</a>)
Rewrite the ifarchive.css file to do something else.
(You may modify the HTML files too, and include images in your design,
but both in moderation. See below.)
</p>

<p>
- Submit your work back to us,
by Feb 8th. Please include
"CSSComp" in the submission field. Also include a title for your design (or
we'll call it "Untitled"). You may add a blurb, which we will display with
your entry on the competition page.
</p>

<p>
- If your entry includes several files, or modifies the HTML files, please
zip/tar your entire work directory and submit that.
</p>

<p>
- You may include small images in your layout, for interesting borders and
so on. You may also include <em>one</em> banner image, for the front page
<em>only</em>. If you want to spice up your design with a URL icon
(favicon), include that too. Put these images in the ./cssimg folder
(currently empty).
</p>

<p>
- You may modify the five HTML files in small, shallow ways. Examples:
adding an &lt;img&gt; tag for a banner; moving or removing the &lt;hr&gt;
tags; changing a &lt;dl&gt; list to &lt;ul&gt;; wrapping &lt;divs&gt; around
elements to enable better CSS.
</p>

<p>
- However, the less you change the HTML, the more favorably the Maintainers
will look upon you. We already have a good assortment of CSS classes and ids
in there, for you to make use of.
</p>

<p>
- No animations. No Javascript. Reactive CSS is okay. We reserve the right
to reject entries that abuse our eyes or web browsers.
</p>

<p>
- DEC-terminal green Courier on a black background may be thematically
appropriate, but it will not win the Maintainers' Choice award. Sorry.
</p>

<p>
- Remember that the IF Archive is used by a lot of blind folks. Also, my
favorite web browser is Lynx. Your HTML must make sense without the CSS.
</p>

<p>
- Entries will be accepted until February 8th, 11:59 pm Eastern. We will add
each submission to the <a href="index.html">directory</a>, <em>as it is
received.</em>
</p>

<p>
- Popular Choice voting will run from February 9th until the 16th. Details
to be determined. (Probably "email Zarf".) We will then tally the votes and
confer, and announce the results of both competitions forthwith.
</p>

<p>
- You grant the Maintainers the right to use your submitted files on the
Archive, and modify them as we see fit. Our final decision for the Archive
design may be a modification of the Maintainers' Choice winner. We will
continue to host the submissions at <a href="index.html">the CSSComp
site</a>, in their original forms, for posterity (and so that the Popular
Choice winner has something to brag about). We will add a line to the front
page crediting the Maintainer's Choice winner.
</p>

<p>
- Archive Maintainers are not barred from entering. I already have one
non-serious entry in there (a demo to show how the CSS classes are laid
out). I plan to submit a real entry too.
</p>

<p>
- Yes, that means I will be judging my own entry. Cope. We're keeping
CSSComp informal -- no discussion blackout, no coordinated release deadline.
We're hoping that the early entries will spark discussion and more entries.
Don't rip off posted entries, please, that would be lame.
</p>

<p>
- This is already too many rules for an informal competition. Go to it.
