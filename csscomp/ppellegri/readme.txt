Web design for The Interactive Fiction Archive web site - Submitted to The IF Archive CSS Competition, January 2009



Changes in HTML mark-up compared with original:

- added indentation (for my own commodity when working) - just ignore it
- removed <hr> elements
- corrected a few apparently missing / inconsistent tags for <p> elements in "genindex.html"



The "alternative" directory contains alternative html which:

- replicates the web site name on all pages (in the <h1> element)
- displays the original page title in an <h2> element within the page (in topindex.html, genindex.html, dirlist.html - in info.html, <h2> replaces <h3> to make "IF Archive License" the page title)

This version might appear a bit more stylistically consistent, although it's largely a matter of personal taste.



Note also that there are three possibilities for the page background (see the css - a texture is used by default, but two alternatives with solid colours are provided).
