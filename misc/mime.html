<h1>A Note on Mime Types</h1>
</div>

<div class="Description">
<p>
IF systems have used a lot of file suffixes over the years. The torrent
has slowed down; people aren't creating new formats with quite the
enthusiasm that they did in the 1990s. But we still have a pretty large
list to keep track of. We want to make sure that binary formats aren't
served as <code>text/plain</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here is the <a href="mime.conf">Apache configuration file</a> that is used
by this web server. It covers all the file suffixes I could find in the
archive. If you're configuring a modern Apache setup, just drop it into
your Apache config directory
<a href="https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/DistrosDefaultLayout">(see
here for more information)</a>.
If you want to use these settings on a shared
virtual host where you do not have administrative access, you can rename
the file to <code>.htaccess</code> and put it in your top-level web
directory.
</p>

<p>
Most of the wacky file formats are just 
<code>application/octet-stream</code>. There's special handling for
Z-code, Glulx, Blorb, and TADS 2 and 3 game files, since they're so common.
These are
<code>application/x-zmachine</code>,
<code>application/x-glulx</code>,
<code>application/x-blorb</code>,
<code>application/x-tads</code>, and
<code>application/x-t3vm-image</code>
respectively.
</p>

<p>
Note that <code>.zblorb</code> and <code>.gblorb</code> files don't have
their own MIME types; they are served as "profiles" of
<code>application/x-blorb</code>. I'm not sure any software understands
profiles in this sense, but I like to think that it'll make something
magically work right someday.
