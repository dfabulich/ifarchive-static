This "misc" directory is for files which are not part of the Archive
data, nor are generated indexes, but should still be replicated to
mirrors. Files in this directory will be few and rarely updated.

If you are running a mirror site, you should copy "index-mirror.html"
to your top level as "index.html", and "htaccess" to your top level as
".htaccess". You should edit index-mirror.html, changing "####" to
your server's actual name.
